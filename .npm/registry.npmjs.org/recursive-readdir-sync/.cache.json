library to recursively read a directory path's contents synchronously\n\nA simple Node module for synchronously listing all files in a directory, or in any subdirectories.\n\nIt does not list directories themselves.\n\nThis library uses synchronous filesystem calls. That means this library uses **BLOCKING** calls. Keep that in mind\nwhen using it.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```\nnpm install recursive-readdir-sync\n```\n\nExample\n-------\n```javascript\nvar recursiveReadSync = require('recursive-readdir-sync')\n  , files\n  ;\n\ntry {\n  files = recursiveReadSync('/your/path/here');\n} catch(err){\n  if(err.errno === 34){\n    console.log('Path does not exist');\n  } else {\n    //something unrelated went wrong, rethrow\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log('Files array:', files);\n\n//loop over resulting files\nfor(var i = 0, len = files.length; i < len; i++){\n  console.log('Found: %s', files[i]);\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"complexcarb","email":"battlejj@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-04T16:02:00.101Z","created":"2015-02-19T22:10:31.663Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-19T22:10:31.663Z","1.0.1":"2015-02-19T22:22:44.237Z","1.0.2":"2015-02-20T02:10:29.834Z","1.0.3":"2015-02-23T21:12:26.946Z","1.0.4":"2015-02-23T22:03:28.511Z","1.0.5":"2015-02-24T00:52:49.624Z","1.0.6":"2015-02-27T23:30:42.974Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/battlejj/recursive-readdir-sync","keywords":["readdir","recursive","readdir","directory","sync","read","sync"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/battlejj/recursive-readdir-sync"},"author":{"name":"Jeremy Battle"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/battlejj/recursive-readdir-sync/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hacksalot":true,"rdesoky":true,"stefanof":true,"arttse":true,"crishernandezco":true,"developit":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"595bbbf8-2699\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 16:02:00 GMT"}
