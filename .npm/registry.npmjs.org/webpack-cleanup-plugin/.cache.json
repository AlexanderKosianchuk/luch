webpack-cleanup-plugin\n\nThis [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) plugin cleans up the extraneous files\nfrom the webpack's output path.\n\nSince it runs when the compile process is finished, it is useful when building\non production to remove the assets created by previous builds.\n\n```\nnpm install webpack-cleanup-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-cleanup-plugin.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cleanup-plugin)\n[![npm

Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/gpbl/webpack-cleanup-plugin.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/gpbl/webpack-cleanup-plugin)\n\n⚠️ **Beware!** This plugins actually delete files. Make sure it's safe for your app\nto delete files not generated by webpack. Use the `exclude` option if you want to\nkeep files that are not webpack assets.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n```\nnpm install webpack-cleanup-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\nThen add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your webpack's config, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nimport WebpackCleanupPlugin from 'webpack-cleanup-plugin';\nconst config = {\n  output: {\n    path: \"/my/output/path\"\n  },\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    new WebpackCleanupPlugin()\n  ]\n}\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### Options\n\n* If you want to keep some files in the output path, e.g. a `stats.json` file generated from some other\nplugins, use the **`exclude`** Array option. It accepts globbing as in [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).\n\n```js\n// Do not delete `stats.json`, `important.json`, and everything in `folder`\nnew WebpackCleanupPlugin({\n  exclude: [\"stats.json\", \"important.js\", \"folder/**/*\"],\n})\n```\n\n* To mute the console output, use the **`quiet`** option:\n\n```js\nnew WebpackCleanupPlugin({\n  quiet: true,\n})\n```\n\n* To print the list of the files that will be deleted without actually deleting them, use the **`preview`** option:\n\n```js\nnew WebpackCleanupPlugin({\n  preview: true,\n})\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gpbl","email":"io@gpbl.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-11-21T09:09:50.023Z","created":"2015-08-25T23:05:23.553Z","0.1.0":"2015-08-25T23:05:23.553Z","0.1.1":"2015-08-25T23:08:05.049Z","0.2.0":"2016-02-13T09:09:24.227Z","0.3.0":"2016-08-20T07:51:04.769Z","0.3.1":"2016-08-31T11:59:22.502Z","0.4.0":"2016-09-18T14:19:10.260Z","0.4.1":"2016-10-13T09:51:57.142Z","0.4.2":"2017-02-11T02:59:53.104Z","0.5.0":"2017-02-27T16:15:18.249Z","0.5.1":"2017-02-27T16:45:54.904Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gpbl/webpack-cleanup-plugin#readme","keywords":["webpack","webpack-plugin"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gpbl/webpack-cleanup-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"gpbl","email":"io@gpbl.org","url":"https://github.com/gpbl"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gpbl/webpack-cleanup-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"craigmorton":true,"maddas":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a13ed5e-5094\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 9:09:50 GMT"}
