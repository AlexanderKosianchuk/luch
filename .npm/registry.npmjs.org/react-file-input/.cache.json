native HTML file inputs can be a pretty big pain, and to make matters worse, the browser default look-and-feel is probably at odds with your app's design. This problem is what react-file-input aims to solve.\n\nOnce integrated, react-file-input quickly eliminates the headaches associated with forms requiring file upload.\n\n## Installation\n```sh\nnpm install react-file-input\n```\n\n## Code Example\nUsage is pretty simple: just use react-file-input instead of `<input type=\"file\" />`!\n\napp.jsx\n```js\nvar React = require('react'),\n  FileInput = require('react-file-input');\n\nvar Form = React.createClass({\n  handleChange: function(event) {\n    console.log('Selected file:', event.target.files[0]);\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <form>\n        <FileInput name=\"myImage\"\n                   accept=\".png,.gif\"\n                   placeholder=\"My Image\"\n                   className=\"inputClass\"\n                   onChange={this.handleChange} />\n      </form>\n    );\n  },\n});\n\n```\n\nThe list of valid props can be found below.\n\n### Props\n\n#### name, accept, className, placeholder, onChange\nBehave just like standard react-style attributes on input controls.\n\n## Contributors\n\nCaptivation Software (@teamcaptivation)\n\nBy all means, if you see room for improvement, let us know!\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dbarbalato","email":"dbarbalato@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-06T06:16:12.473Z","created":"2015-04-21T22:53:45.818Z","0.0.0":"2015-04-21T22:53:45.818Z","0.0.1":"2015-04-22T02:31:23.111Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-22T03:13:57.305Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-22T03:20:05.972Z","0.1.2":"2015-04-22T03:36:51.328Z","0.1.3":"2015-04-26T02:35:41.293Z","0.1.4":"2015-04-26T20:26:38.836Z","0.1.5":"2015-04-26T21:31:13.185Z","0.1.6":"2015-04-27T13:30:46.779Z","0.1.7":"2015-04-27T14:49:57.471Z","0.1.8":"2015-06-24T11:01:34.234Z","0.2.0":"2015-07-12T00:40:07.471Z","0.2.1":"2015-07-18T00:54:25.310Z","0.2.2":"2015-07-18T02:35:10.901Z","0.2.3":"2015-07-18T02:38:40.092Z","0.2.4":"2015-07-18T02:40:39.865Z","0.2.5":"2015-09-25T23:05:35.076Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/captivationsoftware/react-file-input","keywords":["react","react-component","upload","file","input"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/captivationsoftware/react-file-input"},"contributors":[],"author":{"name":"Captivation Software"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/captivationsoftware/react-file-input/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"croogie":true,"abouchard":true,"rhysgoehring":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"595dd5ac-53b2\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 6:16:12 GMT"}
