Each instance of the API class has\n\t * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n\t * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n\t *\n\t * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n\t * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n\t * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n\t * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n\t * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n\t * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n\t * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n\t * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n\t * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n\t *\n\t * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n\t * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n\t * top level object had.

The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n\t\t *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending.

This is the\n\t\t *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n\t\t * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t\t *   initialisation options:\n\t\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t\t *    * Parameters:\n\t\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t\t *    * Return:\n\t\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t\t *        for the data requested.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t\t * with the naming of mRender.

There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation.

If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object.\n\t\t * * `object` - use different data for the different data types requested by\n\t\t *   DataTables ('filter', 'display', 'type' or 'sort').

The plugin defines plot.zoom({ center }), plot.zoomOut() and\nplot.pan( offset ) so you easily can add custom controls. It also fires\n\"plotpan\" and \"plotzoom\" events, useful for synchronizing plots.\n\nThe plugin supports these options:\n\n\tzoom: {\n\t\tinteractive: false\n\t\ttrigger: \"dblclick\" // or \"click\" for single click\n\t\tamount: 1.5         // 2 = 200% (zoom in), 0.5 = 50% (zoom out)\n\t}\n\n\tpan: {\n\t\tinteractive: false\n\t\tcursor: \"move\"      // CSS mouse cursor value used when dragging, e.g. \"pointer\"\n\t\tframeRate: 20\n\t}\n\n\txaxis, yaxis, x2axis, y2axis: {\n\t\tzoomRange: null  // or [ number, number ] (min range, max range) or false\n\t\tpanRange: null   // or [ number, number ] (min, max) or false\n\t}\n\n\"interactive\" enables the built-in drag/click behaviour. If you enable\ninteractive for pan, then you'll have a basic plot that supports moving\naround; the same for zoom.\n\n\"amount\" specifies the default amount to zoom in (so 1.5 = 150%) relative to\nthe current viewport.\n\n\"cursor\" is a standard CSS mouse cursor string used for visual feedback to the\nuser when dragging.\n\n\"frameRate\" specifies the maximum number of times per second the plot will\nupdate itself while the user is panning around on it (set to null to disable\nintermediate pans, the plot will then not update until the mouse button is\nreleased).\n\n\"zoomRange\" is the interval in which zooming can happen, e.g. with zoomRange:\n[1, 100] the zoom will never scale the axis so that the difference between min\nand max is smaller than 1 or larger than 100. You can set either end to null\nto ignore, e.g. [1, null]. If you set zoomRange to false, zooming on that axis\nwill be disabled.\n\n\"panRange\" confines the panning to stay within a range, e.g. with panRange:\n[-10, 20] panning stops at -10 in one end and at 20 in the other. Either can\nbe null, e.g. [-10, null]. If you set panRange to false, panning on that axis\nwill be disabled.\n\nExample API usage:\n\n\tplot = $.plot(...);\n\n\t// zoom default amount in on the pixel ( 10, 20 )\n\tplot.zoom({ center: { left: 10, top: 20 } });\n\n\t// zoom out again\n\tplot.zoomOut({ center: { left: 10, top: 20 } });\n\n\t// zoom 200% in on the pixel (10, 20)\n\tplot.zoom({ amount: 2, center: { left: 10, top: 20 } });\n\n\t// pan 100 pixels to the left and 20 down\n\tplot.pan({ left: -100, top: 20 })\n\nHere, \"center\" specifies where the center of the zooming should happen. Note\nthat this is defined in pixel space, not the space of the data points (you can\nuse the p2c helpers on the axes in Flot to help you convert between these).\n\n\"amount\" is the amount to zoom the viewport relative to the current range, so\n1 is 100% (i.e. no change), 1.5 is 150% (zoom in), 0.7 is 70% (zoom out). You\ncan set the default in the options.\n\n*/\n\n// First two dependencies, jquery.event.drag.js and\n// jquery.mousewheel.js, we put them inline here to save people the\n// effort of downloading them.\n\n/*\njquery.event.drag.js ~ v1.5 ~ Copyright (c) 2008, Three Dub Media (http://threedubmedia.com)\nLicensed under the MIT License ~ http://threedubmedia.googlecode.com/files/MIT-LICENSE.txt\n*/\n(function(a){function e(h){var k,j=this,l=h.data||{};if(l.elem)j=h.dragTarget=l.elem,h.dragProxy=d.proxy||j,h.cursorOffsetX=l.pageX-l.left,h.cursorOffsetY=l.pageY-l.top,h.offsetX=h.pageX-h.cursorOffsetX,h.offsetY=h.pageY-h.cursorOffsetY;else if(d.dragging||l.which>0&&h.which!=l.which||a(h.target).is(l.not))return;switch(h.type){case\"mousedown\":return a.extend(l,a(j).offset(),{elem:j,target:h.target,pageX:h.pageX,pageY:h.pageY}),b.add(document,\"mousemove mouseup\",e,l),i(j,!1),d.dragging=null,!1;case!d.dragging&&\"mousemove\":if(g(h.pageX-l.pageX)+g(h.pageY-l.pageY)<l.distance)break;h.target=l.target,k=f(h,\"dragstart\",j),k!==!1&&(d.dragging=j,d.proxy=h.dragProxy=a(k||j)[0]);case\"mousemove\":if(d.dragging){if(k=f(h,\"drag\",j),c.drop&&(c.drop.allowed=k!==!1,c.drop.handler(h)),k!==!1)break;h.type=\"mouseup\"}case\"mouseup\":b.remove(document,\"mousemove mouseup\",e),d.dragging&&(c.drop&&c.drop.handler(h),f(h,\"dragend\",j)),i(j,!0),d.dragging=d.proxy=l.elem=!1}return!0}function f(b,c,d){b.type=c;var e=a.event.dispatch.call(d,b);return e===!1?!1:e||b.result}function g(a){return Math.pow(a,2)}function h(){return d.dragging===!1}function i(a,b){a&&(a.unselectable=b?\"off\":\"on\",a.onselectstart=function(){return b},a.style&&(a.style.MozUserSelect=b?\"\":\"none\"))}a.fn.drag=function(a,b,c){return b&&this.bind(\"dragstart\",a),c&&this.bind(\"dragend\",c),a?this.bind(\"drag\",b?b:a):this.trigger(\"drag\")};var b=a.event,c=b.special,d=c.drag={not:\":input\",distance:0,which:1,dragging:!1,setup:function(c){c=a.extend({distance:d.distance,which:d.which,not:d.not},c||{}),c.distance=g(c.distance),b.add(this,\"mousedown\",e,c),this.attachEvent&&this.attachEvent(\"ondragstart\",h)},teardown:function(){b.remove(this,\"mousedown\",e),this===d.dragging&&(d.dragging=d.proxy=!1),i(this,!0),this.detachEvent&&this.detachEvent(\"ondragstart\",h)}};c.dragstart=c.dragend={setup:function(){},teardown:function(){}}})(jQuery);\n\n/* jquery.mousewheel.min.js\n * Copyright (c) 2011 Brandon Aaron (http://brandonaaron.net)\n * Licensed under the MIT License (LICENSE.txt).\n * Thanks to: http://adomas.org/javascript-mouse-wheel/ for some pointers.\n * Thanks to: Mathias Bank(http://www.mathias-bank.de) for a scope bug fix.\n * Thanks to: Seamus Leahy for adding deltaX and deltaY\n *\n * Version: 3.0.6\n *\n * Requires: 1.2.2+\n */\n(function(d){function e(a){var b=a||window.event,c=[].slice.call(arguments,1),f=0,e=0,g=0,a=d.event.fix(b);a.type=\"mousewheel\";b.wheelDelta&&(f=b.wheelDelta/120);b.detail&&(f=-b.detail/3);g=f;void 0!==b.axis&&b.axis===b.HORIZONTAL_AXIS&&(g=0,e=-1*f);void 0!==b.wheelDeltaY&&(g=b.wheelDeltaY/120);void 0!==b.wheelDeltaX&&(e=-1*b.wheelDeltaX/120);c.unshift(a,f,e,g);return(d.event.dispatch||d.event.handle).apply(this,c)}var c=[\"DOMMouseScroll\",\"mousewheel\"];if(d.event.fixHooks)for(var h=c.length;h;)d.event.fixHooks[c[--h]]=d.event.mouseHooks;d.event.special.mousewheel={setup:function(){if(this.addEventListener)for(var a=c.length;a;)this.addEventListener(c[--a],e,!1);else this.onmousewheel=e},teardown:function(){if(this.removeEventListener)for(var a=c.length;a;)this.removeEventListener(c[--a],e,!1);else this.onmousewheel=null}};d.fn.extend({mousewheel:function(a){return a?this.bind(\"mousewheel\",a):this.trigger(\"mousewheel\")},unmousewheel:function(a){return this.unbind(\"mousewheel\",a)}})})(jQuery);\n\n\n\n\n(function ($) {\n    var options = {\n        xaxis: {\n            zoomRange: null, // or [number, number] (min range, max range)\n            panRange: null // or [number, number] (min, max)\n        },\n        zoom: {\n            interactive: false,\n            trigger: \"dblclick\", // or \"click\" for single click\n            amount: 1.5 // how much to zoom relative to current position, 2 = 200% (zoom in), 0.5 = 50% (zoom out)\n        },\n        pan: {\n            interactive: false,\n            cursor: \"move\",\n            frameRate: 20\n        }\n    };\n\n    function init(plot) {\n        function onZoomClick(e, zoomOut) {\n            var c = plot.offset();\n            c.left = e.pageX -
